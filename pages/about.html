                <h2>The idea</h2>
                <p>Collaborating with the Head Chef, the menu is being thoughtfully crafted and updated regularly to
                    highlight the diverse techniques and traditions of our dedicated volunteers.
                    Our aim is to not only showcase their rich culinary contributions but also provide a platform for
                    them to enhance existing skills, acquire new ones and gain valuable experience that serves as a
                    stepping stone towards future employment opportunities.</p>
