# The Seven Bridges Cafe

This is an exercise to reimagine the website for The Seven Bridges cafe inside Dance City, Newcastle. I volunteered in their kitchen when the project was just taking shape and helped to cook free meals for people in need. The cafe's director has given me permission to use this as a case study. 


## Strategy

What are the aims for this project and who are its potential users?

I aim to convey the social origin of the cafe and the interest of the business in creating connections, bridges between cultures and people whilst offering a place of learning and community over food. 
In this first deployment, I focus on the basic structure of the site with 3 pages that provide an overview of the cafe, showcase their current menu and design, and finally, provide a contact page for potential volunteers and donors to reach the business. 
### User stories

This project is used by the following users:

- Parents of students at Dance City
    Dance City offers dance classes throughout the week and many of the students are young people who would be accompanied by their parents. On Sunday mornings, there's a Spanish language club with multiple groups or different ages and levels who come to class. The parents are welcomed to wait for the children inside The Seven Bridges cafe.
    Their use of the website: finding about the menu, seasonal dishes, events, opening times, car park suggestions, how to find the cafe.
- Potential Volunteers
    contact form, access social media channels to get inspiration and be inspired to joing the projet. Learn about The Seven Bridges cafe (about) and the West End Refugee Services (WERS. Working in partnership with Dance City to create the project).
